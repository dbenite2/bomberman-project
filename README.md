# Bomberman Project

This project was built with the intention of practice and get deeper knowledge of c++ while having fun creating a game.
It uses unique pointers to have a better memory handle, also it uses the SFML graphics library.

## How to play 

The game works using the wasd and space bar keys, wasd for movement and the space bar for the bomb placement
the bomb will be placed in the same position as the player

## Future implementations

- Power ups for the player
- menu and more levels
- detect enemy collision with player and bomb
- Improvement of the enemy movement
- Game over screen
- A pathfinding algorithm for the enemies, probably A*
